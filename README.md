# Ron's Conway Game of Life
Absolutely the world needs another Conway Game of Life implementation. This version is:
* more colourful
* more exotic
* more "yes, absolutely"  
... than any other version ever written.

## Purpose:
I wanted to learn basic tk (windows) progamming in Linux. I used a very simple learning package from:
* http://www.python-course.eu/index.php (free - thanks guys!)  
... which gave me the basics. And then I just added pices from there.
